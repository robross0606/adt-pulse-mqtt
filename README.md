# adt-pulse-mqtt

ADT Pulse bridge for Home Assistant using MQTT.

Integrates ADT Pulse with Home Assistant. ~~You can also choose to add the ADT Pulse alarm system and ADT devices to your SmartThings. SmartApp allows automatic running our Routines upon alarm changing states.~~

## Home Assistant Setup

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/BigThunderSR/adt-pulse-mqtt)

- First, add the repository (https://github.com/BigThunderSR/adt-pulse-mqtt) using the Add-on Store in the Home Assistant Supervisor. This is the easiest way to run this add-on, but it can also run as an independent container using Docker. In both cases, communication is through MQTT.
- Install ADT Pulse MQTT from the store. Don't forget to configure `pulse_login` with your ADT Pulse Portal username and password. A separate login for Home Assistant is recommended.
- Configure Add-on Options

### ADT Pulse Options

The pulse_login options are:

- username: The ADT Pulse Portal Username
- password: The ADT Pulse Portal Password
- fingerprint: The fingerprint of trusted device authenticated with 2-factor authentication (see below)

### 2-Factor Authentication

ADT Pulse now requires 2-factor authentication and you will need to provide a device fingerprint:

1. Open a Chrome browser tab (under Incognito mode)
2. Open Developer Tools (using **Menu** ➜ **More tools** ➜ **Developer tools** menu or **Ctrl+Shift+I**)
3. Click on the **Network** tab (make sure **Preserve log** checkbox is checked)
4. In the filter box, enter `signin.jsp?networkid=`
5. Go to `https://portal.adtpulse.com` or `https://portal-ca.adtpulse.com` and login to your account
6. Click **Request Code**, type in the requested code, and then click **Submit Code**
7. Click **Trust this device** and name the device `Homebridge`
8. Click **Save and Continue**
9. Click **Sign Out** in the top right corner of the webpage
10. Login to your account (once again)
11. Click on the network call (beginning with `signin.jsp?networkid=`) appearing in the DevTools window. Select the last one.
12. In the **Payload** tab, under **Form Data**, copy the entire **fingerprint** (after `fingerprint:`, do not include spaces)
13. Paste the copied text into the `fingerprint` field into your `config.json`
14. Close the Chrome window (DO NOT sign out)

### MQTT Options

You'll need an MQTT broker. The Mosquitto add-on broker (https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/mosquitto/) is the easiest to implement.

In most cases, only the mqtt_options are needed:

- mqtt_host: core-mosquitto (if using Mosquitto add-on, otherwise hostname or IP address)
- mqtt_connection_options:
  - username: MQTT broker username
  - password: MQTT broker password

In most cases, these options are sufficient. Alternatively, the mqtt_url can be specified instead which allows more advanced configurations (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/mqtt#connect).

### Home Assistant Configuration

This add-on uses the Home Assistant integrations for MQTT Alarm Control Panel and MQTT Binary Sensor.

To configure these, you must edit your configuration.yaml:

To add the control panel:

<pre>
mqtt:
   alarm_control_panel:
     - name: "ADT Pulse"
       state_topic: "home/alarm/state"
       command_topic: "home/alarm/cmd"
       payload_arm_home: "arm_home"
       payload_arm_away: "arm_away"
       payload_disarm: "disarm"
       code_arm_required: false  ## Needs to be added starting with HA Core 2024.6 ##
</pre>

After running the add-on, get a list all the zones found. There are a couple of ways to do this, but they all involve subscribing to the wildcard topic "adt/zones/#".

I recommend the MQTT Snooper app on Android or just use the mosquito command-line command:

<pre>
# mosquitto_sub -h YOUR_MQTT_IP -v -t "adt/zone/#"
</pre>

Once you know the names of MQTT topics for your zones, add the following to the configuration.yaml for each zone in binary_sensor:

<pre>
mqtt:
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "Kitchen Door"
      state_topic: "adt/zone/Kitchen Door/state"
      payload_on: "devStatOpen"
      payload_off: "devStatOK"
      device_class: door
      retain: true
</pre>

This will provide basic support for door sensors. You can add additional binary sensors for other possible state values. As an example, you can add support for a low battery condition on a sensor.

<pre>
mqtt:
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "Kitchen Door Sensor Battery"
      state_topic: "adt/zone/Kitchen Door/state"
      payload_on: "devStatLowBatt"
      payload_off: "devStatOK"
      device_class: battery
</pre>

Note: State topic names come from your Pulse configuration.

The possible state values are:

- devStatOK (device okay)
- devStatOpen (door/window opened)
- devStatMotion (detected motion)
- devstatLowBatt: (low battery condition)
- devStatTamper (glass broken or device tamper)
- devStatAlarm (detected CO/Smoke)
- devStatUnknown (device offline)

If a device type is not listed, open an issue containing your MQTT dump which lists your zones.

## Docker Compose

If you want to run this add-on independently using Docker, here is a sample Docker Compose file:

```
version: '3'
services:
   pulse-adt-mqtt:
      container_name: pulse-adt-mqtt
      image: bigthundersr/adt-pulse-mqtt
      network_mode: host
      restart: always
      volumes:
       - /local/path/to/config-directory:/data~~
```

Sample config.json placed in the config-directory:

```
{
    "pulse_login" : {
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password"
    },
    "mqtt_host" : "mqtt_host"
    "mqtt_connect_options" :  {
      "username" : "username",
      "password" : "password",
      },
    "alarm_state_topic": "home/alarm/state",
    "alarm_command_topic": "home/alarm/cmd",
    "zone_state_topic": "adt/zone",
    "smartthings_topic": "smartthings",
    "smartthings": false
}
```

## ~~Smartthings Support~~ - No Longer Valid Since Smartthings Deprecated Groovy IDE

- ~~In Hassio, setting of the ADT Pulse MQTT set~~
  <strike>
  <pre>
  "smartthings": true
  </pre>
  </strike>

- ~~In SmartThings IDE,~~

1. ~~add the following devicehandlers:
   https://github.com/adt-pulse-mqtt/adt-pulse-mqtt/tree/master/devicetypes/haruny/VirtualADTAlarmSystem.src~~
1. ~~add the following SmartApp:
   https://github.com/adt-pulse-mqtt/adt-pulse-mqtt/tree/master/smartapps/haruny/ADTAlarmSmartApp.src~~
1. ~~Add your devices using SmartThings IDE. You have to name them the same way they appear in ADT Portal.~~
1. ~~Run the SmartApp in your mobile application. Follow the instructions. Do not rename ADT Alarm System device created by the app. Multiple alarm systems/locations is not supported.~~
1. ~~In MQTT Bridge app, select all the devices created (Alarm system, contacts, motion etc.)~~
